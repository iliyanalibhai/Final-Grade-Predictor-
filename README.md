# Final-Grade-Predictor-
Linear Regression model I developed based on data a middle school in Portugal. The goal was for the model to predict student's 3rd trimester grades based on 5 attributes, those being the student's 1st trimester grade, the student's 2nd trimester grade, the amount of failing quiz grades recieved, the amount of study time (scale of 1-5), and the amount of freetime(scale of 1-5). Before creating my Linear Regression model, I read in and cleaned my dataset with pandas so it only read the 5 attributes I wanted it to read. I then set my label, or thing I wnated to predict to be the 3rd trimester grade which was represented with "G3" in my code. With these 5 attributes, I was able to implement a 90% accurate Linear Regression model throigh SciKit-Learn. My model analyzed data that it hadn't learned and had learned which was essemntiall split up into multiple arrays of test data and training data, which was all done through NumPy.
