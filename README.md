# Final-Grade-Predictor-
Linear Regression model I developed based on data from a middle school in Portugal. The goal was for the model to predict the student's 3rd trimester grades based on 5 attributes, those being the student's 1st trimester grade, the student's 2nd trimester grade, the amount of failing quiz grades received, the amount of study time (scale of 1-5), and the amount of freetime (scale of 1-5). Before creating my Linear Regression model, I read in and cleaned my dataset with pandas so it only read the 5 attributes I wanted to use. I then set my label, or 
thing" I wanted to predict to be the 3rd trimester grade which was represented with "G3" in my code. With these 5 attributes, I was able to implement a 90% accurate Linear Regression model through SciKit-Learn. My model analyzed data that it hadn't learned and had learned which was essentially split up into multiple arrays of test data and training data, which was all done through NumPy. For reference the students' grades were scaled from 0-20, 20 being a perfect grade, 0 being a fail.
